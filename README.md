`v11` is a library for Data Oriented Design.
The general idea is to minimize wasted CPU cache by operating exactly on the data needed to solve a particular problem.
This is done by storing data in column-oriented tables, or "Struct Of Arrays" (SOA, as opposed to AOS).
It is a 90Â° inversion of the programming style you learned in school.

This library is still heavily WIP.
